# headwater_streambeds
High-resolution automated detection of headwater streambeds for large watersheds.

This script allows for an analysis of 464.7 km of stream beds. The analysis database consists of 40,354 positions in the known territory, i.e. 20,177 points of presence of stream beds and 20,177 points of absence of stream beds. Analysis were performed using an ROC/AUC curve approach of logistic regressions and a classification tree approach. The analysis were separated according to a three-class hydrological classification.
